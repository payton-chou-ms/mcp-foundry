# VSCode Setup for Foundry MCP Server

Following the guidance from [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers), you can use one of the files in the mcp config files from [the examples](./mcp-configs) to configure your Visual Studio Code in Agent Mode.

You can take the content of the config files that meets your need, and put it in the file `.vscode/mcp.json` in your workspace, and you should be able to start up the MCP server.
